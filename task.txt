Concurrent Job Runner
Focus: goroutines, channels, context, cancellation, backpressure
What it is
A job execution engine that:
Accepts jobs via API or CLI
Runs them concurrently
Can cancel, timeout, retry
Requirements (non-negotiable)
Job has:
ID
command or function
timeout
Worker pool (fixed size)
Graceful shutdown
Context propagation everywhere
Failure scenarios you must handle
Job timeout
Worker panic
App shutdown mid-job
Queue overload
Why this POC matters
This is the foundation of schedulers, agents, and infra tools.
If you can build this cleanly, you understand Go concurrency.
